# drunk_coding

For when you've passed the Ballmer Peak, but you must code! Only the worst code resides here.

### random_sort.py
The goal of this challenge is to create a sorting algorithm that is highly inefficient.

My implementation is to take a list and randomly shuffle it and hope it is sorted.
